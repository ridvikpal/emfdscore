**eMFDscore** is a library for the fast and flexible extraction of various moral information metrics from textual input data. eMFDscore is built on [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) for faster execution and performs minimal preprocessing consisting of tokenization, syntactic dependency parsing, lower-casing, and stopword/punctuation/whitespace removal. eMFDscore lets users score documents with **multiple Moral Foundations Dictionaries**, provides **various metrics for analyzing moral information**, and extracts **moral patient, agent, and attribute words** related to entities.
    
When using eMFDscore, please consider giving this repository a star (top right corner) and citing the following article:

eMFDscore is dual-licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3.0, which permits the non-commercial use, distribution, and modification of the eMFDscore package. Commercial use of the eMFDscore requires an [application](https://forms.gle/RSKzZ2DvDyaprfeE8).

## Install 
eMFDscore requires a Python installation (v3.7+). If your machine does not have Python installed, we recommend installing Python by downloading and installing either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for your OS.

For best practises, we recommend installing eMFDscore into a virtual conda environment. Hence, you should first create a virtual environment by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
$ conda create -n emfd python=3.7
```

Once Anaconda/Miniconda is installed activate the env via:

```
$ source activate emfd
```

Next, you must install spaCy, which is the main natural language processing backend that eMFDscore is built on:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge spacy
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
``` 

Finally, you can install eMFDscore by copying, pasting, and executing the following command: 

`
pip install https://github.com/medianeuroscience/emfdscore/archive/master.zip
`

### eMFDscore in Google Colaboratory

eMFDscore can also be run in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). All you need to do is add these lines to the beginning of your notebook, execute them, and then restart your runtime:

```
!pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
!pip install -U spacy==3.4.0
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
!pip install git+https://github.com/medianeuroscience/emfdscore.git
```

Please make sure your spacy version is 3.4.0 (the output of the below code) or else the library won't work!

```
import spacy
print("spaCy version:", spacy.__version__)
```

You can then use eMFDscore as a python library as documented in our [tutorial](https://github.com/medianeuroscience/emfdscore/blob/master/eMFDscore_Tutorial.ipynb). 

## Usage 
Please refer to this [tutorial](https://github.com/medianeuroscience/emfdscore/blob/master/eMFDscore_Tutorial.ipynb) to learn how to use eMFDscore. 

If you are using the eMFD within the [Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/examining-trends-in-moral-news-framing-across-a-decade-of-television-coverage/) please read the following [documentation](https://github.com/medianeuroscience/emfdscore/blob/master/emfd_gdelt_readme.pdf).  

For using the eMFD on shorter texts (e.g., tweets and news headlines), we suggest to apply the eMFD in a [FrameAxis](https://github.com/negar-mokhberian/Moral_Foundation_FrameAxis).
